              Use two commands for decrypting file mystery.bin.

The file was produced by xoring a famous english book with a constant byte. We
can run a frequency analysis based attack to recover the book title!

First compile the commands by running make

	make

We can generate the occurrence table using another book:

	cat ulysses.txt | ./freqfinder | less

We see that the most recurring characters are

CODE FREQ
0x20 245448 (' ')
0x65 128378 (e)
0x74 89198 (t)
0x6F 82356 (o)
0x61 82067 (a)

Wen can compute the occurrence table of the encrypted file by running

	cat mystery.bin | ./freqfinder | less

and we get

CODE FREQ
0x5B 73369 ([)
0x1E 45750 (^^)
0x0F 29754 (^O)
0x1A 26330 (^Z)
0x14 25064 (^T)

So we can try replacing such characters by using as groundtruth the occurrence
table computed above:

	cat mystery.bin | ./decrypt -0x5B ' ' -0x1E 'e' -0xf 't' -0x1a 'o'

I reveal here that last replacement is wrong, so we should try replacing 0x1a
with the character occurring next, i.e., 'a' and then replace 0x14 with 'o':

	cat mystery.bin | ./decrypt -0x5B ' ' -0x1E 'e' -0xf 't' -0x1a 'a' \
			-0x14 'o'

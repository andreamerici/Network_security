Script generatecerts.sh repeats all steps in the tutorial. It will prompt you
to type passphrases for protecting the generated private keys, and other values
like the common names for the produced certificates.

To use the script, please copy it in your home folder (on the VM is
/home/netsec) together with the file openssl.cnf that is also in the archive.
This openssl.cnf contains the default values that are suggested in the tutorial.

Run the script with:

netsec@netsec:~>./generatecerts.sh

and press enter.

Once it terminates, you will have all files in /home/netsec/certificates as it
is reported in the tutorial and you can use these files for configuring the
webserver.
